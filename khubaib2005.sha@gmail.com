# Employee NFC Logging Time Sheet

An ACR122U card reader and Raspberry Pi are used in this straightforward Python-based NFC attendance system.  Employees can tap their cards to check in and out, and the information is subsequently logged into a shared Google Sheet.  Each scan is accompanied by audio feedback to let the user know it was successful.
